# Advent of Code - 2018 in Python

## What is advent of code ?

The Advent of code is a programming advent calendar done by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).
It is composed of littles puzzles to resolve and to answer on the website.
Because the website need only the solution, you are able to use any programming
language you want.

## Why Python ?

Like you can see on the date of the first commit, I don't do it during December but
during my travel time when I have to go to work. One of the language I master the most
is Python, so this is why I'm looking to do it with it :). But if this reveal to be
easy enough, I'll look to do it in Rust also !

## How to run the code ?

You should be able to run the code like so :

```bash
  python file.py
```

No parameters should be necessary. If something is necessary as an input, a README
file on how-to should be in the folder.

! WARNING ! The code is only Python 3 compliant. Python 2 is old and dead, let him
in peace please.
